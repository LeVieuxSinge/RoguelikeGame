C++ Value vs Pointer vs Reference
	- Value is used in function parameter. Modifications made to the value have no impact outside function.
	- Reference used as alias in function parameter. Modifications made to the reference will have an impact
	outside the function. Shares same memory address as original variable. Cannot be null.
	- Pointer stores a memory address to be access later. Can be null.
